A variable allows us to store data within a program. Variables have a **name** and a **value**.

This variable has the name `animal` and the value `cat`

```python
animal = "cat"
```

This variable has the name `score` and the value `30`

```python
score = 30
```

To create a variable, give it a name and set it equal to a value. The name of the variable always goes on the left, so this code is wrong:

```python
# This code is wrong
30 = score      
```
